## About me

I am a creative and ambitious **Full Stack Developer** with commercial experience in product management, data analytics (stack: SQL/Python) and project management.

I have over 8 years of experience working across multiple countries and industries including tech, consulting, real estate and logistics. Most recently, I was the Product Manager for an E-learning platform at a small startup in London called [Step Function](https://stepfunctioncoaching.co.uk/), where I had a chance to work with great developers and understand the agile software development lifecycle. My strong passion for technical problem-solving and continuous learning, combined with an innate curiosity for how things work, inspired me to transition to software development.

I benefit from having a strong mix of commercial and technical experience including experience with data science and databases. I was fortunate enough to earn a competitive [Forté Foundation Fellowship - Women in Business scholarship](http://www.fortefoundation.org/site/PageServer?pagename=mba_fellows) that partially sponsored my Master of Business Administration (MBA) graduate degree from [IESE Business School](https://www.iese.edu/), where my team and I won Capstone Project Competition for our work with Hewlett Packard.

A quick learner with cross-functional team experience in both analytical and customer-facing roles, I can deliver user-centric and creative (yet practical) solutions that draw from my multi-disciplinary background and deep understanding of internal and external stakeholder needs.

## Skills

#### Creative Problem Solving skills and Analytical Mindset

I enjoy solving problems using a combination of analytical frameworks, data and creative thinking. Some examples include:

- Conducted regular analyses to measure the impact of our marketing initiatives on the company's bottom line as a Strategic Marketing Manager within the Growth and Analytics team. This involved advanced customer and campaign analytics, including calculating customer lifetime value and forecasting sales using tools such as advanced Excel, SQL, and Google Analytics.
- Successfully delivered on one of the high-priority projects in [Gallup](https://www.gallup.com/corporate/212381/who-we-are.aspx), after quickly analysing large amounts of data in multiple languages within a short deadline. See reference on my [Linkedin page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gunelmehdiyeva/).
- Scored a 690 (85th percentile globally) on [Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduate_Management_Admission_Test) exam, a computer adaptive test intended to assess analytical and quantitative reasoning skills (among others) within a month of preparation while working full time.
- Completed a data science project in one week using R programming language to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data after scraping tweets using Twitter API Tweepy to predict who would win the Oscars in 2017.

#### Strong Project Management and Organisational skills

From organising charity events, where the bulk of work coincided with my final year exams and project, to working in fast-paced project-based environments such as sales and consulting against tight client deadlines, I have always thrived working under pressure thanks to my strong organisational and time-management skills. Some examples include:

- Organised two charity events (an exhibition-auction for sales of refugee children’s handicrafts and a fundraising concert for supporting treatment of children with Down Syndrome) during finals week. Despite the deadline pressure, I was included in the Dean’s Honor List for high GPA (94.8 out of 100).
- Co-founded and led Youth Development Public Union, a fundraising NGO for underprivileged children.
- Helped organise[ “Doing Good Doing Well” Conference](https://www.ieserbc.com/) to promote responsible business through Sustainable Development Goals.

#### Effective Communication, Teamwork and Mentorship skills

Working in team-based and project-based environments helped me develop valuable teamwork, communication and stakeholder management skills. I have extensive experience working with people from diverse backgrounds, solving problems in team settings and presenting findings to both technical and non-technical teams in the most efficient way possible. Some examples include:

- Delivered multiple successful presentations in front of internal and external stakeholders as a consultant at Gallup while working closely with cross-functional project teams based in the UK, USA, Germany and Bahrain.

- Successfully mentored two Makers students to help them achieve their personal and professional learning objectives.
- Delivered numerous onsite client pitch presentations and RFPs as a Senior Salesperson at ASE Express. Got promoted to Key Account Manager within months after successfully hitting my sales targets despite no previous background in the industry.

#### Fast and adaptable learner

I take pride in my innate intellectual curiosity and insatiable desire to learn how things work. You can see this in the long list of degrees, courses and countries on my CV. Most importantly, these learning experiences taught me the one essential skill that I believe will help me during my future career as a software developer - to learn how to learn quickly and most efficiently. Some examples include:

- Built a [single-page map application](https://github.com/GunelMC/betwixt) within 10 days using an entirely new library(React) and framework(Next.js) with only limited previous Javascript knowledge.
- Taught myself how to manipulate databases using advanced SQL queries within a month for my job within the Growth and Analytics team.
